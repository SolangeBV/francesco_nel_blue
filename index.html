                            Since his childhood, and thanks to his proximity to the sea (Francesco was born and lived for several years in Mazara del Vallo, Sicily), Francesco was attracted to the sea and the world under water.

                            He was born in 1981, and in Summer 1994 he started to go spearfishing with friends. After the first catches, he kept going more and more often, making this a living for quite a few years. Alongside this, Francesco was hired as a helper in a local swimming pool to teach swimming lessons to children for three years in a row.

                            Few years ago he decided to dive deeper into the techniques behind freediving, and he got the first 3 certifications of PADI freediver at Y-40 in Montegrotto Terme. In May 2025, he will attend an SSI freediver instructor course with Federico Mana as the instructor.

                            Francesco also has a LifeGuard for indoor waters. Francesco always finds time to read more about freediving, experiment with equalization (on himself and on people around him), and also training outside the water. He is looking forward to teach freediving, a long passion of his!
